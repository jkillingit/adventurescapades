            <p>Let me start by saying this is an... expensive suggestion, but it was pretty incredible.  On the south side of the river, there is a hotel called the Yeatman.  It's a botique where every room has a balcony overlooking the north side of the city (pictured above middle), and it has a spa and a two Michelin star restaurant to boot (pictured above right). The Mrs. and I spent a couple days hiking around the castles in Sintra (more on that another time) before heading up to Porto, and our dogs were barking when we checked in.  So we decided to take some time to do a massage at the spa which gets you access to the spa pool (pictured above left).  In addition to all of its own amenities, the hotel is on the side of the river where all the Port cellars are!  The front desk staff at the hotel were some of the friendliest folks I've ever had the pleasure of dealing with and were super helpful getting tour reservations made for us.  Hot tip: Have them do it for you because the hotel is owned by Taylor, the cellar across the street, and has deals with the other cellars around town.</p>

          <p>Taberna dos Mercadores. Let that name sink into your being for a little while.  Taberna dos Mercadores.  Say it again with me.  Taberna dos Mercadores.  Ok, now you're getting it.  This place... oh this place... is a little 15 seat hole in the wall down an unassuming little alley way next to a tunnel on the north side of the river.  Since it is so small, you pretty much have to have a reservation to eat there.  If you're less of a planner, like me, the way you eat there is by getting there 45 minutes before they open for lunch and being the first person in line because it fills up pretty much immediately.  Now onto the important stuff, what to order.  In short, the seafood... as much of it as you think you can eat and still enjoy the rest of your day or evening as the case may be.  My two favorites were the seafood rice (pictured) and the baked octopus.  The baked octopus was the most tender and delicious octopus I've ever eaten in my life and sadly it lives on only in my memory and in my soul because we ate it before we got a picture of it, le sigh.  Like basically the rest of Portugal, the wine was incredible and inexpensive.  The Soalheiro we ordered was 23 euros for the bottle and incredible, the waiter even made mention that it was his favorite bottle on the menu when I ordered it - lucky choice!  Seriously, I can't say enough good things about this place.  Great food, neat atmosphere being so small, and inexpensive at just 88 euros for 2 appetizers, 2 entrees and a bottle of wine for the two of us.  We ate at the restaurant at the Yeatman that I mentioned and it was... several times that expensive and good in its own right, but man if I ever went back you'd find me waiting outside a teeny hole in the wall in an alley at 11am to see my friends at Taberna again.</p>

          <p>There is a lot of great stuff to see in Porto, but these are my top 3 recommendations:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Livraria Lello</li> 
            <li>Torre dos Clerigos</li> 
            <li>Graham's Port Lodge</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Let's start with Livararia Lello, one of the oldest bookstores in Portugal.  Half the reason to go to this place is to check out the interior which includes a beautiful forked staircase and a gorgeous stained glass skylight on the second floor.  In order to enter, you have to buy a ticket at a store just down the street at the corner for 5 euros, don't worry though, you get it back as credit if you buy something at the bookstore.  I picked up a copy of The Lusiads, the origin myth of Portugal.  They sell a special edition of the book that is only available at Livararia Lello which is pretty cool.</p>
          <p>Torre dos Clerigos is actually just down the street from Livararia Lello, so they're a great thing to do in combination.  The tower is attached to a museum and a Baroque church built in the 1700s.  The church is beautiful in its own right, but the real star of the show here is at the top of the tower: an unobstructed panoramic view of all of Porto.</p>
          <p>Finally, there is Graham's Port Lodge.  I thought the guided tour (which is by appointment only by the way, so make one or have your hotel do so for you) at Graham's was pretty incredible.  You'll get the same story about the origin of port and how its made, a walkthrough of the different styles, and will get to see the cellars, but what distiguishes Graham's is the view.  A balcony just off the tasting room offers an incredible view of the city as you enjoy whatever extra little port tastes you might want to squeeze in in addition to the ones included with the tour.  I HIGHLY recommend bringing some home with you, too.  You will have access to an infinitely better selection of ports at any of the cellars in Porto than you will find anywhere in the US.</p>
